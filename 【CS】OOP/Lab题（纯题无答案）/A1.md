# Assignment01 Students 1

Write a program that asks you 10 records of students. Each record consists of a name (w/o space), and scores for three courses (in integer, 1 to 5). Output a list as following and calculate average score (in float) of each student and each course. Output the lowest and highest score for each course.

```
no      name    score1  score2  score3  average
1       K.Weng  5       5       5       5
2       T.Dixon 4       3       2       3
3       V.Chu   3       4       5       4
4       L.Tson  4       3       4       3.66667
5       L.Lee   3       4       3       3.33333

        average 3.8     3.4     3.6
        min     2       2       1
        max     5       5       5
```

**Evaluation standard**

1. result correctness
2. c++ code quality (compact and reasonable)
3. comments quality (clean and accurate)
4. c functions like `printf` and `scanf` are not allowed

**Required Files**: source code

**Optional Files**: CMakeLists.txt (for cmake build)
